Section 1 of TIS had attend a virtual industry talk about an overview of ICT jobs hosted by Mr. Yee and his colleagues. 
The main point that wanted to deliver to us is ICT jobs scope. For instance, those UI and UX designer used Figma to design, Slack for communication and Phrase to do translate language. Not just this, numeric challenges such as finding balance between work and studies need to be confronted. That’s is what life called. By attending this informative talk, I got a better understanding about ICT. it unlocks treasury of information by empowering people with key to fiscal wisdom, securing a brighter future in industry.

What I gained from this talk is time management. We as students need time to do revision since we have a myriad of quizzes and tests. At the same time, joining activity of cocurricular is vital for us to get merits too. Hence, our time management need to be well so that time will not be wasted. Besides, we need to put effort in completing our group assignment. Throughout this, some values such as teamwork, responsibility and hardworking can be implemented. 

REFLECTION: Nowadays, ICT contributes economic growth by generating employment opportunities. As technology keep advancing, there is an increasing demand for ICT jobs such as data analyst. Hence, ICT sector in industry will be enlarge from time to time.

On 30.10.2023, we as group 11 have a hands-on session to do assemble and reassemble a PC. After the guidance of the assistant, we are able to assemble and reassemble the PC successfully. For me, it was my first time to see how a PC is built up. At the same time, I have learnt and remember the step of assemble and reassemble a PC. It was really fantastic to do this task since I never expect I will make it in one day. 

REFLECTION:Throughout this session, I learnt to be more careful and try my best to avoid carelessness during assembling a PC. Besides, my suggestion about the improvement is try to make more interesting hands-on session to students so that they will not feel boring with the course. It will not only enhance the passion but also interest too. As the saying goes, kill one bird with two stones. Lastly, it was worth for me to learn about it.

Design Thinking is process that creating some new and innovative ideas and solving problems. It focuses on humans needs and will come up with effective solutions to meet those needs. It also can improve the products by analyzing and understanding how users interact with products and investigating the conditions in which they operate. In Design Thinking process has five phases that are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.

At first, it was really difficult for us to do this task as we have no idea about it at all. After some guidance from Puan Azurah, we gained some directions and goals to settle this task. 


REFLECTION: My main goal is to become a successful cybersecurity analyst in the future. I hope that I can advance expertise in specialized areas within cybersecurity such as network security. Moreover, keeping up to date with the latest trends and skills are crucial in order to make contribution to innovation. Furthermore, design thinking impacts my goal from the perspective of iterative. It is because design thinking allows for the continual refinement of security measures and adapting to emerging threats. By utilizing design thinking, I realised that this is the best way to provide solutions based on real life problems given. This further strengthen my goal that can do contribution to the people needed. Moreover, I need to always update my understanding of technologies and security implications such as IoT in order to enhance my ability. Lastly, I believe that by improving my technology skills, I will prove my potential and self-value in the industry.


NALI 2023
![NALI](https://github.com/Mlrn206/EPORT/assets/147963500/d241f3db-32f4-42ed-a8cb-b5f2d4f63d30)
On 6,7 and 8 November 2023, New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI) held an exhibition at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM Johor Bahru. My friends and I visited this exhibition on day 2. Throughout this exhibition, we gained an insight on the innovation products in teaching and learning. Every booth has its unique ideas and learning models. Some examples of booth that we visited such as Virtual Lab and Thai MOOC. Those booths are really fascinating since they make us have an eye-opener towards future trends. This provides a platform for NALI practitioners to share and present their research findings and innovations findings to public in NALI fields.

We managed to interview 3 booths in NALI which is Virtual Lab, Thai MOOC and the NXT Prime. We are able to obtain lots of information about their exhibition goals. First and foremost, we went to Virtual Lab which is held by UTM CDex. The aim is to innovating student’s lab experience in order to empower students with creative skills. This booth enables educators to reimagine their laboratories through immersive online stimulations so that they can solve real-world problems. Using VR as the main tool to guide participants during the booth is interesting. The features included 360 virtual tour, interactive contents and customized platform. It was totally developing the newest and latest trends nowadays. For example, I joined the hands-on session with the Virtual Lab in order to have better understanding about VR.

Furthermore, Thai MOOC is a digital lifelong learning platform. It provides an E-learning service catering to people from diverse educational by using Inter-University Network which is known as UniNet. This is able to enhance accessibility to tertiary education. Thai MOOC’s goal is to foster a knowledge-based society by creating a strong foundation to everyone. What I learnt from this booth is live and learn no matter how old you are.

Lastly, we visited to a booth that exhibited a mini-industry named NXT Prime Burger Factory. This module is developed for students regarding the elements of Industry Revolution (IR 4.0).  It is a combination of Lego Spike Prime Education and Lego Mindstorms NXT as a stimulation of the teaching and learning process for RBT subjects in nutrition technology. This is designed to show a real simulation of food processing in order to achieve better learning objectives in an effective way. This module totally expands the knowledge of PISMP RBT about the basic components such as sensors to students. 
Moreover, the team members from 4 different school of engineering have their different roles when they have to work as a team and conduct this project. As a result, all of the 15 groups from this project are completed successfully their robotic project above-average marks. This showed that team members with different personality types worked well together in an interdisciplinary project. The results also showed that personality inventories can be used as an academic guidance tool in forming effective teams.

REFLECTION:It is really an awesome experience for me to attend this NALI exhibition as I have the opportunity to explore more about learning innovation and trend in the 21st century. After visiting exhibition booths, I was so impressed that there are so many new learning innovations like project-based learning and VR for students to solve the real-life challenges. In my opinion, this innovation assists students to enhance passion and interest in learning as it is not a boring task anymore. Last but not least, NALI do inspire me that learning can also be fun and fantastic by using technology
