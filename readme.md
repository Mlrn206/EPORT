 As a year 1 student from SECRH , i'm very appreciated having this golden oppurtunity to attend this virtual talk and industry visit to UTM Digital. On 5.12.2023, we had a virtual talk on UTM DIGITAL- OUR DIGITAL UNIVERSITY DRIVER from 3-5pm via Webex. The speaker,Mr Helmee bin Yaacob and his colleagues were delivering a fanstatic informative talk to all of us. It is really awesome! What we gained from the talk is UTM ID and know the ICT service for students.Besides, digital architecture, digital strategy, and digital innovation are the three primary divisions that make up UTM Digital.During the first session, Ms . Alinda binti Mohamed Aris discussed the fundamental of UTM Digital services with a particular focus on the creation of technology platforms and applications.In the following session,the speaker who known as TS.MR. Mohamed bin Mohd Hasni gave a summary of the UTM data centre's infrastructure and construction projects from 2008 to 2019 by highlighting its standards which include plenty of space and strong security. Furthermore, On 11.12.2023, we had an industry visit to UTM Digital in Skudai, Johor. On that day, we were welcomed by some senior IT officers who are Madam Diniha Miskam and Madam Aslinda. All of the staff were extremely amiable to us. We had approximately 70 people who took part in it in order to know more about how UTM Digital works. Then, our group had an interview session with Encik Muhammad Syafiq who is a IT Officer that develop UTM SMART.

Design Thinking is process that creating some new and innovative ideas and solving problems. It focuses on humans needs and will come up with effective solutions to meet those needs. It also can improve the products by analyzing and understanding how users interact with products and investigating the conditions in which they operate. In Design Thinking process has five phases that are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.

On 6,7 and 8 November 2023, New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI) held an exhibition at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM Johor Bahru. My friends and I visited this exhibition on day 2. Throughout this exhibition, we gained an insight on the innovation products in teaching and learning. Every booth has its unique ideas and learning models. Some examples of booth that we visited such as Virtual Lab and Thai MOOC. Those booths are really fascinating since they make us have an eye-opener towards future trends. This provides a platform for NALI practitioners to share and present their research findings and innovations findings to public in NALI fields.

We managed to interview 3 booths in NALI which is Virtual Lab, Thai MOOC and the NXT Prime. We are able to obtain lots of information about their exhibition goals. First and foremost, we went to Virtual Lab which is held by UTM CDex. The aim is to innovating student’s lab experience in order to empower students with creative skills. This booth enables educators to reimagine their laboratories through immersive online stimulations so that they can solve real-world problems. Using VR as the main tool to guide participants during the booth is interesting. The features included 360 virtual tour, interactive contents and customized platform. It was totally developing the newest and latest trends nowadays. For example, I joined the hands-on session with the Virtual Lab in order to have better understanding about VR.

Furthermore, Thai MOOC is a digital lifelong learning platform. It provides an E-learning service catering to people from diverse educational by using Inter-University Network which is known as UniNet. This is able to enhance accessibility to tertiary education. Thai MOOC’s goal is to foster a knowledge-based society by creating a strong foundation to everyone. What I learnt from this booth is live and learn no matter how old you are.

Lastly, we visited to a booth that exhibited a mini-industry named NXT Prime Burger Factory. This module is developed for students regarding the elements of Industry Revolution (IR 4.0).  It is a combination of Lego Spike Prime Education and Lego Mindstorms NXT as a stimulation of the teaching and learning process for RBT subjects in nutrition technology. This is designed to show a real simulation of food processing in order to achieve better learning objectives in an effective way. This module totally expands the knowledge of PISMP RBT about the basic components such as sensors to students. 
Moreover, the team members from 4 different school of engineering have their different roles when they have to work as a team and conduct this project. As a result, all of the 15 groups from this project are completed successfully their robotic project above-average marks. This showed that team members with different personality types worked well together in an interdisciplinary project. The results also showed that personality inventories can be used as an academic guidance tool in forming effective teams.
