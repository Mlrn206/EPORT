					<h2>NALI 2023 EXHIBITION & COMPETITION</h2>
					</header>
					<p>On 6,7 and 8 November 2023, New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI) held an exhibition at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM Johor Bahru. My friends and I visited this exhibition on day 2. Throughout this exhibition, we gained an insight on the innovation products in teaching and learning. Every booth has its unique ideas and learning models. Some examples of booth that we visited such as Virtual Lab and Thai MOOC. Those booths are really fascinating since they make us have an eye-opener towards future trends. This provides a platform for NALI practitioners to share and present their research findings and innovations findings to public in NALI fields.
						We managed to interview 3 booths in NALI which is Virtual Lab, Thai MOOC and the NXT Prime. We are able to obtain lots of information about their exhibition goals.</p>

					<P> First and foremost, we went to Virtual Lab which is held by UTM CDex. The aim is to innovating student’s lab experience in order to empower students with creative skills. This booth enables educators to reimagine their laboratories through immersive online stimulations so that they can solve real-world problems. Using VR as the main tool to guide participants during the booth is interesting. The features included 360 virtual tour, interactive contents and customized platform. It was totally developing the newest and latest trends nowadays. For example, I joined the hands-on session with the Virtual Lab in order to have better understanding about VR.  </P>

					<P> This module is developed for students regarding the elements of Industry Revolution (IR 4.0).  It is a combination of Lego Spike Prime Education and Lego Mindstorms NXT as a stimulation of the teaching and learning process for RBT subjects in nutrition technology. This is designed to show a real simulation of food processing in order to achieve better learning objectives in an effective way. This module totally expands the knowledge of PISMP RBT about the basic components such as sensors to students. 
						Moreover, the team members from 4 different school of engineering have their different roles when they have to work as a team and conduct this project. As a result, all of the 15 groups from this project are completed successfully their robotic project above-average marks. This showed that team members with different personality types worked well together in an interdisciplinary project. The results also showed that personality inventories can be used as an academic guidance tool in forming effective teams.
