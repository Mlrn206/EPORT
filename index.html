					<h2>NALI 2023 EXHIBITION & COMPETITION</h2>
					</header>
					<p>On 6,7 and 8 November 2023, New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI) held an exhibition at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM Johor Bahru. My friends and I visited this exhibition on day 2. Throughout this exhibition, we gained an insight on the innovation products in teaching and learning. Every booth has its unique ideas and learning models. Some examples of booth that we visited such as Virtual Lab and Thai MOOC. Those booths are really fascinating since they make us have an eye-opener towards future trends. This provides a platform for NALI practitioners to share and present their research findings and innovations findings to public in NALI fields.
						We managed to interview 3 booths in NALI which is Virtual Lab, Thai MOOC and the NXT Prime. We are able to obtain lots of information about their exhibition goals.</p>
					<p>Virtual Lab  </p> <img src="c:\Users\MELODY LUI\Downloads\VR.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"/>
					<h2>This is a video: </h2>

					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<P> First and foremost, we went to Virtual Lab which is held by UTM CDex. The aim is to innovating student’s lab experience in order to empower students with creative skills. This booth enables educators to reimagine their laboratories through immersive online stimulations so that they can solve real-world problems. Using VR as the main tool to guide participants during the booth is interesting. The features included 360 virtual tour, interactive contents and customized platform. It was totally developing the newest and latest trends nowadays. For example, I joined the hands-on session with the Virtual Lab in order to have better understanding about VR.  </P>
					<P></P>
					<P>Thai MOOC</P>
					<img src="c:\Users\MELODY LUI\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\THAAIMO.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"/> 
					<img src=" c:\Users\MELODY LUI\Downloads\THAIMO2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height= "500" />
					<P>Thai MOOC is a digital lifelong learning platform. It provides an E-learning service catering to people from diverse educational by using Inter-University Network which is known as UniNet. This is able to enhance accessibility to tertiary education. Thai MOOC’s goal is to foster a knowledge-based society by creating a strong foundation to everyone   </P>

					<video src=" video burger.MOV " controls width="500"></video> 

					<P> This module is developed for students regarding the elements of Industry Revolution (IR 4.0).  It is a combination of Lego Spike Prime Education and Lego Mindstorms NXT as a stimulation of the teaching and learning process for RBT subjects in nutrition technology. This is designed to show a real simulation of food processing in order to achieve better learning objectives in an effective way. This module totally expands the knowledge of PISMP RBT about the basic components such as sensors to students. 
						Moreover, the team members from 4 different school of engineering have their different roles when they have to work as a team and conduct this project. As a result, all of the 15 groups from this project are completed successfully their robotic project above-average marks. This showed that team members with different personality types worked well together in an interdisciplinary project. The results also showed that personality inventories can be used as an academic guidance tool in forming effective teams.

				<p>Assignment 2: Industry Visit & Virtual Talk - UTM Digital 🏢☀️</p>

                <p>As a year 1 student from SECRH , I'm very appreciated having this golden oppurtunity to attend this virtual talk and industry visit to UTM Digital.
                On 5.12.2023, we had a virtual talk on UTM DIGITAL- OUR DIGITAL UNIVERSITY DRIVER from 3-5pm via Webex.

                 Hence, it can motivate students to excel in their coursework. We learned about development of an app especially UTM SMART. 
                 We are able to see how concepts in lectures are implemented in real-world settings.This can be interesting and make coursework feel more relevant.
                Furthermore, those activities offered real-world examples that can spark interest and enthusiasm among students.
                For example, the Q&A sessions during visit and talk allow students to clarify doubts and obtain a deeper understanding. 
                Moreover, this visit offered a different learning experience can be refreshing. So, it enhances engagement and excitement in the learning process.</p>


				<p>Assignment 3  : INDUSTRY TALK 2: System Development @ Credence> </p>

                <p>For me, I would like to always be updated on the latest technologies and trends in system development by participating some related communities in the next 4 years. By joining some computer science and system development activities, I am able to gain hands-on experience and sharpen my weaknesses.</p>


				<p>Assignment 4  : Tech-Driven Innovation - Unleashing the Powers of Emerging Technologies for Business Growth in Urban Farming Solution (I-Farm) </p>

				<p>By developing technology in human life, it will not only enhance the overall well-being and quality of life for individuals but also contributing towards the economic growth of our country. For example, I-Farm. This talk had motivated me that no matter how little our power is, as long as we take action, we will definitely bring changes to our lives.
					 Next, innovation in various sectors, especially the environmental.
					 It is because it can minimizes the environmental footprint compared to traditional agriculture. Consequently , it can collectively contribute to a more sustainable, resilient, and consumer-friendly approach in order to providing fresh products , positively impacting human life in terms of health, convenience, and environmental sustainability.</p>

                <p>PC Assemble</p>
					
				<p>Throughout this session, I learnt to be more careful and try my best to avoid carelessness during assembling a PC. Besides, my suggestion about the improvement is try to make more interesting hands-on session to students so that they will not feel boring with the course. It will not only enhance the passion but also interest too. As the saying goes, kill one bird with two stones. Lastly, it was worth for me to learn about it.</p>
					
				<p>Design Thinking</p>
					
				<p>My main goal is to become a successful cybersecurity analyst in the future. I hope that I can advance expertise in specialized areas within cybersecurity such as network security. Moreover, keeping up to date with the latest trends and skills are crucial in order to make contribution to innovation. Furthermore, design thinking impacts my goal from the perspective of iterative. It is because design thinking allows for the continual refinement of security measures and adapting to emerging threats. By utilizing design thinking, I realised that this is the best way to provide solutions based on real life problems given. This further strengthen my goal that can do contribution to the people needed. Moreover, I need to always update my understanding of technologies and security implications such as IoT in order to enhance my ability. Lastly, I believe that by improving my technology skills, I will prove my potential and self-value in the industry.</p>

				<p>NALI</p>
				<p>It is really an awesome experience for me to attend this NALI exhibition as I have the opportunity to explore more about learning innovation and trend in the 21st century. After visiting exhibition booths, I was so impressed that there are so many new learning innovations like project-based learning and VR for students to solve the real-life challenges. In my opinion, this innovation assists students to enhance passion and interest in learning as it is not a boring task anymore. Last but not least, NALI do inspire me that learning can also be fun and fantastic by using technology.</p>
