					<h2>NALI 2023 EXHIBITION & COMPETITION</h2>
					</header>
					<p>On 6,7 and 8 November 2023, New Academia Learning Innovation (NALI) held an exhibition at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM Johor Bahru. My friends and I visited this exhibition on day 2. Throughout this exhibition, we gained an insight on the innovation products in teaching and learning. Every booth has its unique ideas and learning models. Some examples of booth that we visited such as Virtual Lab and Thai MOOC. Those booths are really fascinating since they make us have an eye-opener towards future trends. This provides a platform for NALI practitioners to share and present their research findings and innovations findings to public in NALI fields.
						We managed to interview 3 booths in NALI which is Virtual Lab, Thai MOOC and the NXT Prime. We are able to obtain lots of information about their exhibition goals.</p>
					<p>Virtual Lab  </p> <img src="c:\Users\MELODY LUI\Downloads\VR.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"/>
					<h2>This is a video: </h2>
					 
					<video src="VR VIDEO.MP4" controls width="500"></video> 
					<P> First and foremost, we went to Virtual Lab which is held by UTM CDex. The aim is to innovating student’s lab experience in order to empower students with creative skills. This booth enables educators to reimagine their laboratories through immersive online stimulations so that they can solve real-world problems. Using VR as the main tool to guide participants during the booth is interesting. The features included 360 virtual tour, interactive contents and customized platform. It was totally developing the newest and latest trends nowadays. For example, I joined the hands-on session with the Virtual Lab in order to have better understanding about VR.  </P>
					<P></P>
					<P>Thai MOOC</P>

					<img src=" c:\Users\MELODY LUI\Downloads\THAIMO2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height= "500" />
					<P>Thai MOOC is a digital lifelong learning platform. It provides an E-learning service catering to people from diverse educational by using Inter-University Network which is known as UniNet. This is able to enhance accessibility to tertiary education. Thai MOOC’s goal is to foster a knowledge-based society by creating a strong foundation to everyone   </P>

					<video src=" video burger.MOV " controls width="500"></video> 

					<P> This module is developed for students regarding the elements of Industry Revolution (IR 4.0).  It is a combination of Lego Spike Prime Education and Lego Mindstorms NXT as a stimulation of the teaching and learning process for RBT subjects in nutrition technology. This is designed to show a real simulation of food processing in order to achieve better learning objectives in an effective way. This module totally expands the knowledge of PISMP RBT about the basic components such as sensors to students. 
						Moreover, the team members from 4 different school of engineering have their different roles when they have to work as a team and conduct this project. As a result, all of the 15 groups from this project are completed successfully their robotic project above-average marks. This showed that team members with different personality types worked well together in an interdisciplinary project. The results also showed that personality inventories can be used as an academic guidance tool in forming effective teams.

                Moreover,I have learned about their companies' background and the distributions they made in this technology era.

                By interacting with professionals during industry visits can enhance students' communication and interpersonal skills.
                It builds a network within the industry of interest among students and fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. 
                Besides, this activity provides a platform for students in solidifying understanding and reinforces the relevance of academic content.

                 Hence, it can motivate students to excel in their coursework. We learned about development of an app especially UTM SMART. 
                 We are able to see how concepts in lectures are implemented in real-world settings.This can be interesting and make coursework feel more relevant.
                Furthermore, those activities offered real-world examples that can spark interest and enthusiasm among students.
                For example, the Q&A sessions during visit and talk allow students to clarify doubts and obtain a deeper understanding. 
                Moreover, this visit offered a different learning experience can be refreshing. So, it enhances engagement and excitement in the learning process.</p>
